"Name","Child Poverty by Household Type"
"Description","Children in single parent households are defined as the
biological, adopted, or step children of household
heads in family households where no spouse is present.&nbsp;Other households are those for whom the child's relationship to householder is defined as other relative, foster or unrelated child.&nbsp;Due to small sample sizes in smaller geographies, data are presented in 3-year averages; 2019 = 2017-2019 3-year average.&nbsp;"
"Source Notes","CCC analysis of U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates, Public Use Microdata Sample Files (2012 - 2019)."
"Notes","The Federal Poverty Level (FPL) is an income threshold calculated by the U.S. Census Bureau each year for the purpose of estimating the number of individuals and households living in poverty. The income threshold varies based on the number of children and adults in a household and the age of the head of household. In 2019, the FPL for a household consisting of two adults and two children was $25,750. The Census Bureau excludes institutionalized individuals, individuals living in military group quarters or college dorms, and unrelated individuals under 15 years of age from poverty estimates. Percents refer to the percent of the children in the selected household type for whom poverty status was determined.&nbsp;"
