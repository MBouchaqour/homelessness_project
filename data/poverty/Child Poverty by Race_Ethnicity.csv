"Name","Child Poverty by Race/Ethnicity"
"Description","Children under 18 years in households with incomes below the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) by race and ethnicity. Racial/ethnic groups are defined as follows: White = non-Latino White alone, Black = non-Latino Black alone, Asian = non-Latino Asian or Pacific Islander alone, Latino = Latino of any race. Due to small sample sizes in smaller geographies, data are presented in 3-year averages; 2019 = 2017-2019 3-year average."
"Source Notes","U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 3-Year Estimates, Public Use Microdata Sample File (2007 - 2019); retrieved from&nbsp;<a href=""https://data.census.gov/"" target=""_blank"">https://data.census.gov/</a>."
"Notes","The Federal Poverty Level (FPL) is an income threshold calculated by the U.S. Census Bureau each year for the purpose of estimating the number of individuals and households living in poverty. The income threshold varies based on the number of children and adults in a household and the age of the head of household. In 2019, the FPL for a household consisting of two adults and two children was $25,750. The Census Bureau excludes institutionalized individuals, individuals living in military group quarters or college dorms, and unrelated individuals under 15 years of age from poverty estimates. Percents refer to the percent of the children in the selected racial/ethnic group for whom poverty status was determined.&nbsp;"
