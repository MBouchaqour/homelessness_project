"Name","Child Poverty by Poverty Level"
"Description","Poverty level is the ratio of household income to the Federal Poverty Level (FPL).&nbsp;The FPL varies based on the number of children and adults in a household and the age of the head of household. In 2019,&nbsp;<a href=""https://aspe.hhs.gov/2019-poverty-guidelines"" target=""_blank"">the annual income thresholds for a family of four</a>&nbsp;would correspond to the following breakdown of poverty levels:<br />
Below 100% FPL = Below $25,750<br />
100 to 199% FPL = $25,750 to $51,499<br />
Below 200% FPL = Below $51,500<br />
200 to 399% FPL = $51,500 to $102,999<br />
400% FPL and above = $103,000 and above"
